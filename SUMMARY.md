## Questions You Might Have

**Q: Should I remove the strategy documents from my profile repository?**
A: Optional. They're useful reference documents but not part of your public profile. You could move them to a private notes repository or keep them here for reference.

**Q: How often should I update my profile?**
A: Every 3 months for general updates, immediately for major achievements, and before any job application season.

**Q: Can I add GitHub stats back?**
A: Not recommended. Stats widgets often show inflated or meaningless metrics. Your real projects are more impressive.

**Q: Should I add emojis?**
A: Minimal use only (like the 🏆 for awards). Avoid emoji overload - it looks unprofessional.

**Q: What if I want to add new projects?**
A: Follow the templates in `REPOSITORY_TEMPLATES.md`. Add to README.md in the "Selected Projects" section.

**Q: How do I create a portfolio website?**
A: That's a separate project. You can use your profile content as a starting point. Consider using Next.js, Gatsby, or a static site generator.
