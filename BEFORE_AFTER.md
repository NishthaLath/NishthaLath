## The Core Difference

**BEFORE:** "Look at me, I'm a coder!"  
**AFTER:** "I build AI systems that solve real problems."

**BEFORE:** Trying to impress with animations  
**AFTER:** Impressing with substance and depth

**BEFORE:** Student project feel  
**AFTER:** Professional engineer ready for serious work

---

## Recommendation

**Keep the new version.** 

The old version might have looked "fun" or "creative," but it was working against you in professional contexts. The new version positions you as a serious AI engineer with research credentials and production experience.

**This is what recruiters and research labs want to see.**
