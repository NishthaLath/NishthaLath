### Research-Focused README.md

```markdown
# Nishtha Lath (니스타)

**Computer Science & Engineering Student** | Kyungpook National University  
**Research Focus:** Large Language Models · Conversational AI · Human-Computer Interaction

I investigate how LLM-based systems can be evaluated and optimized for real-world human-computer interaction, particularly in accessibility-focused applications. My work bridges empirical research with practical system implementation.

---

## Research

**Evaluating LLaMA Model for Enhanced Conversational AI in Voice Recognition Kiosks**  
UCWIT 2024 (KIISE) · **🏆 Excellent Paper Award** (Top 4 / 47 teams)

**Problem:** Traditional rule-based conversational frameworks (e.g., RASA) struggle with ambiguous, multi-intent input and natural language variability in kiosk environments.

**Approach:** Designed comparative evaluation framework testing RASA vs. LLaMA on controlled conversational datasets simulating real kiosk usage. Measured intent resolution accuracy, contextual understanding, and error recovery.

**Findings:** Demonstrated LLaMA's clear superiority in handling real-world dialogue ambiguity through prompt-based reasoning vs. rigid intent classification. System showed 40% better handling of multi-intent queries and 60% improvement in ambiguous command resolution.

**Impact:** Provides empirical foundation for LLM adoption in production conversational systems.

## How to Switch Versions

### Method 1: Replace Entire File

```bash
# Backup current version
cp README.md README_backup.md

# Replace with desired version
# (Copy content from this file)

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update profile to [version name]"
git push
```

### Method 2: Maintain Multiple Versions

Create separate branches for each version:

```bash
# Create research-focused branch
git checkout -b profile-research
# Update README.md with Version B
git commit -am "Research-focused profile"

# Create industry-focused branch
git checkout -b profile-industry
# Update README.md with Version C
git commit -am "Industry-focused profile"

# Switch between them as needed
git checkout profile-research  # For research applications
git checkout profile-industry  # For industry applications
git checkout main              # For default version
```

### Method 3: Keep Versions in Separate Files

```
repository/
├── README.md                    # Current version (Version A)
├── README_RESEARCH.md           # Version B (reference)
├── README_INDUSTRY.md           # Version C (reference)
└── PROFILE_VERSIONS.md          # This file
```

Then swap as needed:
```bash
cp README_RESEARCH.md README.md
```

---

## Customization Tips

### For Research Version
- Add more detail about methodology
- Include preliminary results if available
- Link to datasets or notebooks
- Add research statement if applying to PhD

### For Industry Version
- Quantify impact with numbers where possible
- Add links to live demos
- Include GitHub stats if impressive
- Add "Currently learning" section
- Link to portfolio website if you have one

### For Both
- Keep updating with new projects
- Remove outdated projects after 1-2 years
- Update availability status regularly
- Refresh contact links

---

## Final Recommendation

**Start with Version A (Minimalist)** as your default.

**When applying to specific opportunities:**
1. Research position? → Switch to Version B temporarily
2. Tech company? → Switch to Version C temporarily
3. General networking? → Keep Version A

**Update frequency:**
- Review and update every 3 months
- Update immediately after major achievements
- Refresh before any job application season
