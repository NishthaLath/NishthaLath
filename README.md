## Experience

**Frontend Developer Intern (Team Leader)** | RikkeiSoft Corporation  
*Dec 2024 – Jan 2025*

Led frontend development for an internal AI chatbot platform serving employees, administrators, and clients. Architected the entire React/TypeScript UI with role-based dashboards, prompt customization, and file management systems.

**Undergraduate Lab Intern** | Intelligent Software Systems Lab, KNU  
*Oct 2025 – Dec 2025*

Built RAG-based disaster response assistant integrating legal manuals, population data, and geospatial risk information. Implemented FAISS vector store with LangChain pipelines and optimized FastAPI backend for fast, context-aware decision support.
